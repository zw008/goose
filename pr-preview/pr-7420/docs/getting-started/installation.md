          :::info Permissions
          If you're on an Apple Mac M3 and the goose Desktop app shows no window on launch, check and update the following:

          Ensure the `~/.config` directory has read and write access.

          goose needs this access to create the log directory and file. Once permissions are granted, the app should load correctly. For steps on how to do this, refer to the  [Known Issues Guide](/docs/troubleshooting/known-issues#macos-permission-issues)

      <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        To install goose natively on Windows, you need one of the following environments:
        - **Git Bash** (recommended): Comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
        - **MSYS2**: Available from [msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)
        - **PowerShell**: Available on Windows 10/11 by default

        Run the installation command in your chosen environment:

        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash

        curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | CONFIGURE=false bash
        ```

        **PowerShell Installation:**
        Download the PowerShell installation script to your current directory.

        ```powershell
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/block/goose/main/download_cli.ps1" -OutFile "download_cli.ps1";
        ```
        Then run the script to install goose:
        ```powershell
        .\download_cli.ps1
        ```

        :::info Windows PATH Setup
        If you see a warning that goose is not in your PATH, you need to add goose to your PATH:

        <details>
          <summary>For Git Bash/MSYS2</summary>
          ```bash
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
          source ~/.bashrc
          ```
        </details>

        <details>

        <details>
        <summary>Install via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</summary>

          We recommend running the goose CLI natively on Windows, but you can use WSL if you prefer a Linux-like environment.

          1. Open [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) as Administrator and install WSL and the default Ubuntu distribution:

          ```bash
          wsl --install
          ```

          2. If prompted, restart your computer to complete the WSL installation. Once restarted, or if WSL is already installed, launch your Ubuntu shell by running:

          ```bash
          wsl -d Ubuntu
          ```

          3. Run the goose installation script:
          ```bash
          curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
          ```
          :::tip
            If you encounter any issues on download, you might need to install `bzip2` to extract the downloaded file:

            ```bash
            sudo apt update && sudo apt install bzip2 -y
            ```

          ```

          If needed, add goose to your path:

          ```
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
          echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc

## Set LLM Provider
goose works with [supported LLM providers][providers] that give goose the AI intelligence it needs to understand your requests. On first use, you'll be prompted to configure your preferred provider.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
    On the welcome screen the first time you open goose, choose how to configure a provider:
    <OnboardingProviderSetup />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
    The CLI automatically enters configuration mode where you can choose how to configure a provider:

    - **OpenRouter Login** - Sign in with OpenRouter to automatically configure models
    - **Tetrate Agent Router Service Login** - Sign in with Tetrate Agent Router Service to automatically configure models
    - **Manual Configuration** - Choose a provider and enter credentials manually

    Example configuration flow:

    ```
    ┌   goose-configure
    │
    ◇ How would you like to set up your provider?
    │ Tetrate Agent Router Service Login
    │
    Opening browser for Tetrate Agent Router Service authentication...
    [goose opens the browser and prints details]

    Authentication complete!

    Configuring Tetrate Agent Router Service...
    ✓ Tetrate Agent Router Service configuration complete
    ✓ Models configured successfully

    Testing configuration...
    ✓ Configuration test passed!
    ✓ Developer extension enabled!
    └ Tetrate Agent Router Service setup complete! You can now use goose.
  ```

  :::info Windows Users
  If you choose to manually configure a provider, when prompted during configuration, choose to not store to keyring. If you encounter keyring errors when setting API keys, you can set environment variables manually instead:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_api_key}
  ```

  Then run `goose configure` again. goose will detect the environment variable and display:

  ```
  ● OPENAI_API_KEY is set via environment variable
  ```

  To make API keys persist across sessions, add them to your shell profile:
  ```bash
  echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Free Credits Offer
You'll receive $10 in free credits the first time you automatically authenticate with Tetrate through goose. This offer is available to both new and existing Tetrate users.

## Running goose

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
        Starting a session in the goose Desktop is straightforward. After choosing your provider, you'll see the session interface ready for use.

        Type your questions, tasks, or instructions directly into the input field, and goose will get to work immediately.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        From your terminal, navigate to the directory you'd like to start from and run:
        ```sh
        goose session
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Shared Configuration Settings

The goose CLI and Desktop UI share all core configurations, including LLM provider settings, model selection, and extension configurations. When you install or configure extensions in either interface, the settings are stored in a central location, making them available to both the Desktop application and CLI. This makes it convenient to switch between interfaces while maintaining consistent settings. For more information, visit the [Config Files][config-files] guide.

:::info
While core configurations are shared between interfaces, extensions have flexibility in how they store authentication credentials. Some extensions may use the shared config files while others implement their own storage methods.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
    <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
        Navigate to shared configurations through:
        1. Click the <PanelLeft className="inline" size={16} /> button in the top-left to open the sidebar.
        2. Click the `Settings` button on the sidebar.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
        Use the following command to manage shared configurations:
        ```sh
        goose configure
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pin a goose version in CI/CD
In CI/CD (and other automated, non-interactive environments), pin a specific version with `GOOSE_VERSION` to make installs reproducible and avoid 404s when downloading the goose CLI binary assets if the `stable` release tag doesn’t include them.

See [CI/CD Environments](/docs/tutorials/cicd) for a complete example and usage details.

## Additional Resources

You can also configure Extensions to extend goose's functionality, including adding new ones or toggling them on and off. For detailed instructions, visit the [Using Extensions Guide][using-extensions].
