This tutorial covers how to add the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon) as a goose extension to interact with your Neon Postgres databases and manage your projects, branches, and more.

Neon offers two versions of the MCP server:

1. **Remote MCP server** hosted by Neon, which redirects you to neon.com to sign in to your Neon account.
2. **Local MCP server** that you can run on your own machine using an API key to connect with a specific organization or your personal account.

:::warning Security Note
The Neon MCP Server grants powerful database management capabilities and is intended for local development only - always review LLM-requested actions before execution and avoid using in production environments.

  :::info Prerequisites

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0.0 or higher) installed on your system to run this command, as it uses `npx`
  - Neon API key to authenticate the Neon MCP Server with your Neon account. You can create one from the [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech) under your Profile settings. Refer to the [Neon documentation on API Keys](https://neon.com/docs/manage/api-keys#creating-api-keys) for detailed instructions.

For all setup and configuration options, see the [official Neon MCP Server documentation](https://neon.com/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server).

## Example Usage 1

Get an overview of all your Neon database projects and their configurations.

### goose Prompt

```
List my Neon projects
```

### goose Output

```
I'll help you list your Neon projects using the neon__list_projects tool. By default, it will show the first 10 projects.

Here are your Neon projects:

1. laravel-test (ID: mute-mountain-08595850)
- Region: AWS US East 2
- Created: July 23, 2025
- PostgreSQL: v17

2. rls-test (ID: noisy-hill-99207787)
- Region: AWS US East 2
- Created: July 20, 2025
- PostgreSQL: v17

3. neon-auth-test (ID: rapid-pond-81053507)
- Region: Azure East US 2
- Created: July 7, 2025
- PostgreSQL: v17

4. saas-starter-kit-nextjs (ID: misty-poetry-78149700)
- Region: AWS US West 2
- Created: June 23, 2025
- PostgreSQL: v17
- Note: Has logical replication enabled

5. neon-auth-mcp-oauth (ID: gentle-base-21700263)
- Region: AWS US West 2
- Created: June 4, 2025
- PostgreSQL: v17

All projects are running PostgreSQL 17 and have autoscaling configured between 1-2 compute units. Would you like more detailed information about any specific project?
```

## Example Usage 2

Discover what tables and schemas exist within a specific project.

### goose Prompt

```
What tables do I have in my neon-auth-mcp-oauth project?
```

### goose Output

```
In your neon-auth-mcp-oauth project, there is one table:

users_sync in the neon_auth schema
```

## Example Usage 3

Run queries against your database tables to retrieve and analyze your data.

### goose Prompt

```
Count the rows in the users_sync table.
```

### goose Output

```
I'll count the rows in the neon_auth.users_sync table using a COUNT query.

Total Records: 1 row
Table Location: Schema neon_auth, Table users_sync
Project: neon-auth-mcp-oauth (Project ID: gentle-base-21700263)
Content: Contains one user record
```
