The Todo extension helps goose stay organized by breaking complex work into a series of steps and keeping you updated as it completes each step.

goose automatically knows to use the Todo extension for tasks involving multiple files/components or uncertain scope. At the start of the task, goose will create an internal checklist, read and update progress as it works, and verify that all tasks are completed.

:::tip
You can ask goose to "show me the current todo list" at any time to see what's being tracked.

This tutorial will cover enabling and using the Todo extension.

## Example Usage

In this example, I'm going to have goose help me fix formatting inconsistencies in documentation files. This demonstrates how the Todo extension helps goose stay organized when working through systematic improvements.

### goose Prompt

```
I need to update our documentation to fix formatting inconsistencies between two tutorial files. There are several sections that don't match the expected pattern. Can you help me systematically work through these issues and track our progress?
