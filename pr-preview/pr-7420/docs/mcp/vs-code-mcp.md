## Example Usage

The VS Code MCP extension enables goose to interact with your VS Code environment, managing files, projects, and development workflows. 

The key strength of the VS Code MCP Server is its ability to:

- Show diffs before making changes
- Integrate file operations with VS Code's interface
- Manage project workspaces
- Provide immediate visual feedback in the editor

:::note
Every time you start a goose session with the VS Code MCP server enabled, it checks to see if a matching project is open in VS Code. If not, it will prompt you to open the project before proceeding.
