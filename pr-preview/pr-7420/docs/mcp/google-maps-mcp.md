## Example Usage

goose acts as an autonomous agent that tracks a delivery driver’s location, updates the customer in real-time, and adjusts ETAs dynamically based on Google Maps traffic data.

goose can:

**Monitor Driver Location**
* goose gets the driver’s GPS coordinates every few seconds.
* If the driver’s location is significantly behind schedule, goose recalculates the ETA.

**Traffic-Aware ETA Adjustments**
* goose queries Google Maps for live traffic conditions.
* If delays are detected, goose updates the customer’s tracker with a new estimated time.

**Dynamic Customer Notifications**
* If the driver is stuck in traffic, goose sends an alert to the customer: “Your driver is running late due to traffic. Updated ETA: 7:25 PM.”
* If the driver is ahead of schedule, goose notifies the restaurant to prepare the food earlier.

### goose Prompt
```
Track the live GPS location of driver ID #12345. Query Google Maps for real-time traffic data and adjust the estimated delivery time if delays exceed 5 minutes. If ETA changes, update the customer’s live tracker and send an SMS notification. If the delay is greater than 20 minutes, check if another driver within a 1-mile radius can take over the delivery.
```

### goose Output

:::note CLI
Okay, I will track Driver #12345, query Google Maps for traffic data, adjust the ETA, and notify the customer.

**Track Driver's GPS Location**

*   **Driver ID:** #12345
*   **Starting Point:** 1955 Broadway, Suite 600, Oakland, CA 94612

Driver #12345's movement:

```
2025-02-23 08:20:00: Latitude: 37.8074, Longitude: -122.2697 (Starting point)
2025-02-23 08:21:00: Latitude: 37.8080, Longitude: -122.2690
2025-02-23 08:22:00: Latitude: 37.8090, Longitude: -122.2680
2025-02-23 08:23:00: Latitude: 37.8100, Longitude: -122.2670
```

**Geocode Destination Address**

*   **Customer Address:** 2111 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA

I will convert this address into geographic coordinates:

`─── maps_geocode | googlemaps ──────────────────────────`

address: 2111 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA

```
Latitude: 37.7631446
Longitude: -122.4192073
```

**Get Initial Directions and ETA**

I will get the initial route and ETA from the driver's starting point to the customer's address.

`─── maps_directions | googlemaps ──────────────────────────`

destination: 2111 Mission St, San Francisco, CA
mode: driving
origin: ...

```
Distance: 12.1 miles
Initial ETA: 21 minutes
Estimated arrival at: 08:41 AM
```

**Monitor Traffic and Adjust ETA**

I will monitor traffic updates and recalculate the ETA periodically.

```
Remaining Distance: 8 miles
Updated ETA: 15 minutes
Estimated arrival at: 08:45 AM
```

There is no significant delay.

*At 08:35 AM:* There's a traffic incident. 

`─── maps_directions | googlemaps ──────────────────────────`

destination: 2111 Mission St, San Francisco, CA
mode: driving
origin: Latitude: 37.8100, Longitude: -122.2670

I apologize, I am unable to use the lat/long for the request. I will call google maps api with names instead.

`─── maps_directions | googlemaps ──────────────────────────`

destination: 2111 Mission St, San Francisco, CA
mode: driving
origin: ...

```
Remaining Distance: 7 miles
Updated ETA: 26 minutes
Estimated arrival at: 08:46 AM
```

The ETA has increased by 5 minutes from the original ETA of 08:41 AM. The directions now include a message: "Expect delays due to congestion."

**Update Customer and Send SMS**

[... other extensions used (e.g. Webhooks, MySQL, ClickSend)...]

*   **Update Live Tracker:** The customer's live tracking interface is updated to reflect the new ETA of 08:46 AM.
*   **Send SMS Notification:** _"Your delivery is now expected to arrive at approximately 08:46 AM due to traffic. We apologize for the inconvenience."_
