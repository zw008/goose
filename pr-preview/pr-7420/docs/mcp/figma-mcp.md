This tutorial covers how to add the [Figma Dev Mode MCP Server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server) as a goose extension to enable interaction with Figma files, designs, and components.

:::info
The MCP Server requires a Dev or Full seat on Professional, Organization, or Enterprise Figma plans.

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Required Setup**

The Dev Mode MCP Server must be enabled in the [Figma desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/)
:::

## Configuration

1. Follow the instructions in Figma's [Guide to the Dev Mode MCP Server](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server) to enable the MCP Server.

   Your server will now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`

   :::info Alternative Setup
   If you don't see a `Preferences` menu in the desktop app as described in the instructions, try this:
   1. Click the `</>` toggle at the bottom of your design file
   2. In the right panel, toggle `Enable MCP server`
   :::

2. Add the Figma extension to goose:
   <Tabs groupId="interface">
     <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
       <GooseDesktopInstaller
         extensionId="figma"
         extensionName="Figma"
         description="Convert Figma designs into code and extract design context"
         type="http"
         url="http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"
       />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
       <CLIExtensionInstructions            
         name="figma"
         description="Convert Figma designs into code and extract design context"
         type="http"
         url="http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"
         timeout={300}
       />
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Example Usage

The Figma extension in goose works alongside the Figma desktop app. You can use the extension to:
- Convert Figma designs into production-ready code (React, Vue, HTML/CSS, etc.)
- Extract design tokens, variables, and generate design system rules
- Capture visual references of your designs

Let's try converting a Figma design into React code. First, copy the link:
  1. Open a design file in the [Figma desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) where the MCP Server is enabled
  2. In the layers panel, right-click any frame or component and choose `Copy link to selection`

:::tip
You can provide goose with a Figma link or simply select an element in the Figma desktop app.

I'll help you convert that Figma design to React. Let me first examine the Figma file to understand the design structure and components.

```
manage_extensions action, extension_name
```

I'll help you convert that Figma design to React. Let me first extract the node ID from the URL and then generate the React code for you.

```
get_code nodeId, clientLanguages, clientFrameworks
```

```
get_image nodeId, clientLanguages, clientFrameworks
```

I've successfully converted your Figma design to React! Here's the generated component:

```jsx
const imgImage1 = "http://localhost:3845/assets/e0e0f6accb741cb6cacec2697cef047a7eea7e30.png";

function Component1() {
  return (
    <div className="relative size-full" data-name="Component 1" data-node-id="351:8">
      <div className="absolute bg-[#d9d9d9] inset-0 rounded-lg" data-node-id="351:2" />
      <div
        className="absolute font-['Inter:Black',_sans-serif] font-black inset-[23.33%_2.56%_22.22%_56.41%] leading-[normal] not-italic text-[#333b43] text-[20px]"
        data-node-id="351:3"
      >
        <p className="block mb-0">ask</p>
        <p className="block">goose</p>
      </div>
      <div
        className="absolute aspect-[92/90] bg-center bg-cover bg-no-repeat left-0 right-[52.82%] rounded-lg top-0"
        data-name="image 1"
        data-node-id="351:6"
        style={{ backgroundImage: `url('${imgImage1}')` }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default function Component2() {
  return (
    <div className="relative size-full" data-name="Component 1" data-node-id="351:8">
      <Component1 />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Key Features of the Generated Component:

- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Uses Tailwind classes for responsive design and styling
- **Image Asset**: The goose logo is loaded from a localhost server as a background image  
- **Typography**: Uses Inter Black font for the "ask goose" text
- **Layout**: Positioned absolutely with precise inset values to match the Figma design
- **Responsive**: Uses relative positioning and percentage-based insets for scalability

#### Component Structure:
- **Background**: Light gray rounded container (#d9d9d9)
- **Logo**: goose silhouette image positioned on the left side
- **Text**: "ask goose" text positioned on the right in dark gray (#333b43)

The component maintains the exact visual hierarchy and styling from your Figma design while being fully responsive and ready to integrate into a React application with Tailwind CSS.
