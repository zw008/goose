# Recipes

goose recipes are files that contain all the details to allow goose to do one specific task. Since they are contained in just one file, they are easy to share through all the normal ways we share files, including version management systems like git. Let's get started with the simplest recipe possible.

## The Simplest Recipe

The simplest recipe is basically just a prompt. This might seem not all that useful—after all I can just share my prompt on Slack or email—but it turns out that the most important reason users can't get agents to do what they want is that their prompts are too short and that they don't iterate enough on those prompts. Keeping prompts in a text file helps with both these things. 

Here's a recipe that will plan a trip to Europe:

```yaml
title: Trip planner
description: Plan your next trip
prompt: |
 Help the user plan a trip to Europe for 14 days.
 Create a detailed itinerary that includes:
  - places to visit
  - activities to do
  - local cuisine to try
  - a rough budget estimate
```

You can run it from the command line using:

```sh
goose run --recipe trip.yaml
```

## Extensions

goose recipes have a section where you can specify which [extensions](/docs/guides/recipes/recipe-reference#extensions) goose can use during execution. goose will only use the ones you specify. 

Let's say we want to make sure we have good weather during our Europe trip. We can just add a weather extension (this example uses the [weather-mcp-server](https://github.com/TuanKiri/weather-mcp-server) by TuanKiri under the MIT License) to our recipe, modify the prompt a bit and now goose will check the weather before adding a city to our trip.

```yaml
title: Trip planner
description: Plan your next trip
prompt: |
 Help the user plan a trip to Europe for 14 days. Create a detailed itinerary that includes:
  - places to visit
  - activities to do
  - local cuisine to try
  - a rough budget estimate
 Ensure that the user has good weather throughout their trip. Optimize their trip based on the forecast in potential locations.
extensions:
  - type: stdio
    name: weathermcpserver
    cmd: /Users/svega/Development/weather-mcp-server/weather-mcp-server
    args: []
    timeout: 300
    description: "Weather data for trip planning"
    env_keys:
      - WEATHER_API_KEY
```

## Parameters

We can make our recipes dynamic by adding parameters. Parameters are variables that are provided by the user of our recipes. They each have a data type and a requirement field that defines if they are required, optional or provided by the user. We can generalize our trip recipe by adding a parameter for the destination and the length of the trip:

```yaml
parameters:
  - key: destination
    input_type: string
    requirement: required
    description: Destination for the trip. Should be a large region with multiple climates.
  - key: duration
    input_type: number
    requirement: required
    description: Number of days for the trip.
```

Recipes use a template system that lets you insert variables like `{{ destination }}` which get filled in with the actual values you provide. Once you've updated the prompt with the right details, you can run your new recipe like this to get a plan for a 14 day trip to Africa:

```sh
goose run --recipe trip.yaml --params destination=Africa --params duration=14
```

## Settings

By default, goose uses the `temperature` and `model` you've already chosen, which usually works just fine. But sometimes you might want more control. For example, when performing a subjective task like planning a trip, it can help to turn up the `temperature` setting. Think of temperature like a creativity dial - the higher it is, the more varied and unexpected the results. If the first suggestion isn't quite right, the user can just run the recipe again to get a new one.

You can also specify which AI provider and model to use for a specific recipe:

```yaml
settings:
  goose_provider: "anthropic"
  goose_model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
  temperature: 0.8
```

The available settings are:
- `goose_provider`: The AI provider (e.g., "anthropic", "openai")
- `goose_model`: The specific model name
- `temperature`: Controls creativity/randomness (0.0-1.0, higher = more creative)

These settings will override your default goose configuration when this recipe runs.

## External Files

Sometimes, you'll want to give the agent access to extra information without cramming all that data into the prompt. Instead of pasting everything in, you can keep the data in a separate file and point the recipe to it.

To help with this, recipes include a built-in variable called `{{ recipe_dir }}`, which lets you reference files stored alongside your recipe. For example, you could download the UNESCO list from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/unesco-heritage-sites2021?resource=download) and use it in your travel planning recipe.

Then we reference the file in our prompt like:

```yaml
prompt: |
 You can use the \{\{ recipe_dir \}\}/unesco.csv file to 
 check information on UNESCO world heritage sites to
 include in your travel plan.
```

We also need to specify an extension to read files:

```yaml
extensions:
 - type: builtin
   name: developer
   display_name: Developer
   timeout: 300
   bundled: true
```

Here we add the [Developer extension](/docs/mcp/developer-mcp) which provides the ability to read files for relevant information.
