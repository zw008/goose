# Error Handling in goose

Error handling is a key performance-driving part of goose. There are many ways that the non-determinism
in the LLM can introduce an error that it can in turn recover from. In a typical goose session, it's expected for there
to be several agent errors that the model can see directly and correct, perhaps entirely behind the scenes.

## Traditional Errors

While the agent is operating, there can be intermittent issues in the network, availability of the
foundational model, etc. These are raised as errors in the agent API to the caller, who can decide
how to handle that. We generally handle these with [anyhow::Error][anyhow-error]. 

## Agent Errors

There are several types of errors where everything is working correctly, but the model generations
themselves are somehow causing errors. Things like generating an unknown tool name, incorrect parameters, 
or a well formed tool call that results in an error in the tool itself. All of these can be surfaced to
the LLM to have it attempt to recover. 

The error messages are in some ways prompting - they give instructions to the LLM on how it might go
about recovering. We handle these with [thiserror::Error][this-error] and carefully maintain a collection.

To cover all these cases, both `ToolUse` and `ToolResult` are typically passed through the API as part of a
`Result<T, AgentError>`. An error in a `ToolUse` will immediately become an error in a `ToolResult` and
passed back to the LLM. A valid `ToolUse` might still end up in an error `ToolResult`, which is also passed
back to the LLM. 

The providers then handle translating the agent errors into the various API specs as valid messages.
