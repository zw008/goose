## Example Usage

In this example, I’ll show you how to use goose with the ElevenLabs Extension to create AI-generated voiceovers for a YouTube Short. goose will take a sample script I provided, generate a narrated version using different AI voices, and seamlessly switch tones mid-script to match the content flow.

By connecting to the ElevenLabs MCP server, goose can transform plain text into natural-sounding speech, offering multiple voice styles and character options — all without any manual recording or editing.

### goose Prompt

> Hey goose, create a script for me for my youtube short video, I want there to be two different voices. The first voice should cut me off and be a human narrator style and then switch to a casual AI tone after I read the prompt. Here's an example of a YT short script I've done in the past: 

Wait… Within Seconds, goose performed Security Audits Across Multiple Projects?! 🔥

Lets, plug & play to find out how 

Let’s provide goose with the command it needs to connect to the Filesystem MCP server extension…

Now lets play 
prompt:  "Hey goose, I need to perform a security audit across multiple projects. Let's check for…🔹 Hardcoded Credentials – API keys, passwords, and secrets left in the code.🔹 SQL Injection Risks – Unsafe queries that could expose data.🔹 Insecure Cryptographic Practices – Weak encryption methods that put data at risk.AND🔹 Exposed Config Files – Sensitive information that shouldn't be public.🔹 Outdated Dependencies – Security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries."

Go goose, go goose!

✅ goose scanned the entire codebase across 3 different projects, identified security risks, generated a detailed report with fixes and provided me with step by step instructions on how I can test and verify these code fixes! 

If that’s not amazing idk what is …
