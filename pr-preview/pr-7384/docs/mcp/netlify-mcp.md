### Add Netlify MCP Server

:::info
Note that you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to run this command, as it uses `npx`.

    extensionName="Netlify"
    description="Build, deploy, and manage sites with Netlify's official MCP server."

    I'll help you deploy your tic-tac-toe app to Netlify from your GitHub repository. Let me first check your Netlify account and then set up the deployment.

    ─── netlify-user-services | netlify ──────────────────────────

    selectSchema: <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation: get-user <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;params:

    Great! I can see you're logged into Netlify with your GitHub account connected. Now let me create a new Netlify site and deploy your tic-tac-toe app from your GitHub repository.

    ─── netlify-project-services | netlify ──────────────────────────

    selectSchema:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation: create-new-project<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;params:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: tic-tac-toe-game

    Let me try a different name for the project:

    ─── netlify-project-services | netlify ──────────────────────────

    selectSchema:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation: create-new-project<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;params:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: janedoe-tic-tac-toe

    Perfect! I've created a new Netlify site called "janedoe-tic-tac-toe". Now I need to deploy your code from the GitHub repository. Let me deploy the site:

    ─── netlify-deploy-services | netlify ──────────────────────────

    selectSchema:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation: deploy-site<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;params:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deployDirectory: /Users/janedoe/Development/tic-tac-toe<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;siteId: 1731e49e-1d0a-49a3-ad95-975b550f324a

    Let me check the deployment status and get the live URL for your site:

    ─── netlify-project-services | netlify ──────────────────────────

    selectSchema:<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operation: get-project<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;params:<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;siteId: 1731e49e-1d0a-49a3-ad95-975b550f324a
</details>

🎉 **Success! Your tic-tac-toe game has been deployed to Netlify!**

## Deployment Details:

- **Live Site URL**: http://janedoe-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app
- **Netlify Project Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com/projects/janedoe-tic-tac-toe
- **Site ID**: 1731e49e-1d0a-49a3-ad95-975b550f324a

## What was deployed:

✅ **HTML**: Your main game interface

✅ **CSS**: Modern styling with animations and responsive design

✅ **JavaScript**: Complete game logic and interactivity

✅ **README**: Project documentation

## Next Steps:

1. **Visit your live site**: http://janedoe-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app
2. **Test the game**: Make sure everything works as expected
3. **Share with others**: Your game is now live on the web!

## Future Updates:

Since your code is deployed from your local directory, if you want to make changes:

1. Update your local files
2. Push changes to your GitHub repository
3. You can either:
   - Redeploy manually using the same command
   - Set up continuous deployment from GitHub (which would auto-deploy when you push changes)

Would you like me to help you set up continuous deployment from your GitHub repository so that future changes are automatically deployed?

Your tic-tac-toe game is now live and ready to play! 🎮
