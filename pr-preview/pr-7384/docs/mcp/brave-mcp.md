## Example Usage

The Brave Search MCP server gives you access to the Brave Search API, providing both web and local search capabilities:

- **Web Search**: General queries, news, articles, with pagination and freshness controls
- **Local Search**: Find businesses, restaurants, and services with detailed information (requires a Pro API key)
- **Flexible Filtering**: Control result types, safety levels, and content freshness
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Local search automatically falls back to web when no results are found

#### goose Prompt

```
( O)> Organize a Italian dinner party with Ian, Rizel, Ace, and Ebony. Find 3 or 4 YouTube cooking channels (with URLs) that focus on Italian cuisine for beginners, and then find one recipe (with URL) for each person to make: one salad, two entrees, and one dessert.
```

#### goose Output

```

I'll help you organize the Italian dinner party and search for appropriate cooking resources and recipes. Let me break this down into parts.

First, let's search for some beginner-friendly Italian cooking YouTube channels:

Let me search for some specific recipes:

Brave Web Search
query: authentic italian salad recipes panzanella caprese insalata

Brave Web Search
query: authentic italian main course pasta recipes carbonara osso b...

Brave Web Search
query: authentic italian dessert recipes tiramisu panna cotta

Based on my research, I'll organize the dinner party plan with recommended YouTube channels and specific recipes for each person. Here's the plan:

Recommended Italian Cooking YouTube Channels for Beginners

1. Vincenzo's Plate (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcsSowAamCLJv-xeF9geXoA)
  - Authentic Italian recipes with clear instructions
  - Run by an Italian native who explains techniques well for beginners

2. Italia Squisita (https://www.youtube.com/c/ItaliaSquisita)
  - Features traditional Italian recipes
  - Often shows multiple ways to make classic dishes

3. Giallo Zafferano (https://www.youtube.com/user/GialloZafferano)
  - Italy's most popular cooking channel
  - Comprehensive collection of authentic Italian recipes

Recipe Assignments

1. Rizel - Salad Course
  - Classic Panzanella (Tuscan Bread and Tomato Salad)
  - Recipe: https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tomato-panzanella-salad-recipe/
  - Perfect summer salad with crusty bread, tomatoes, and fresh basil

2. Ian - First Entrée
  - Authentic Spaghetti Carbonara
  - Recipe: https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/spaghetti-carbonara/
  - Classic Roman pasta dish with eggs, pecorino, and guanciale

3. Ace - Second Entrée
  - Osso Buco alla Milanese
  - Recipe: https://www.pastagrammar.com/post/osso-buco-authentic-italian-veal-recipe

4. Ebony - Dessert

Tips for Success

- Watch the YouTube channels beforehand to familiarize yourself with Italian cooking techniques
- Make sure to read through the entire recipe before starting
- The Panna Cotta should be made at least 4 hours ahead (or the night before) to allow proper setting time
- The Panzanella can be assembled just before serving for the best texture
- The Osso Buco can be made slightly ahead and reheated, as it often tastes better the next day
- The Carbonara should be made just before serving and served immediately while hot
