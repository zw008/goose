## Example Usage
GitMCP allows you to convert any Git repository into a goose extension. The goose Docs MCP Server is a great example of this, as it provides a way for goose to answer questions about itself.

Let's ask goose to create a recipe for us! It will use the goose Docs MCP Server to find the relevant information.

### goose Prompt

```
hey goose, I want to create a recipe for automated code review that my development team can use. Can you look at the goose documentation to understand the recipe format, then create a recipe that:

1. Reviews pull requests for:

- Code quality issues and best practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing unit tests
- Performance concerns

2. Should be parameterized so teams can customize:

- Programming language (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Minimum test coverage threshold
- Specific coding standards to enforce

3. Should output structured results that can be parsed by CI/CD systems

Please research the recipe format first using the goose Docs extension, then create a complete recipe file with proper YAML structure, parameters, and any needed extensions. 
Make it something a development team could immediately use in their workflow.
```

### goose Output

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive automated code review recipe based on the goose documentation research. Here's what I've built for your development team:

#### 📋 Recipe Overview

The **Automated Code Review** recipe (`automated-code-review.yaml`) provides:

#### ✅ **Core Review Areas**
1. **Code Quality & Best Practices** - Architecture, naming, complexity, documentation
2. **Security Vulnerability Assessment** - OWASP Top 10, input validation, auth issues
3. **Test Coverage Analysis** - Missing tests, coverage thresholds, test quality
4. **Performance Concerns** - Bottlenecks, algorithm complexity, resource management
5. **Technical Debt Assessment** - Refactoring needs, maintainability issues

#### 🔧 **Parameterization Features**
- **`programming_language`** - Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, TypeScript, etc.
- **`min_test_coverage`** - Customizable threshold (default: 80%)
- **`coding_standards`** - PEP8, ESLint, Google Style Guide, company-specific
- **`security_focus`** - Basic, standard, or comprehensive security analysis
- **`performance_analysis`** - Enable/disable performance review
- **`exclude_patterns`** - Skip certain files/directories

#### 📊 **Structured CI/CD Output**
The recipe outputs a comprehensive JSON structure with:
- **Overall quality score** and recommendation (approve/request changes/reject)
- **Categorized issues** with severity levels and specific file locations
- **Security vulnerabilities** with CWE IDs and remediation steps
- **Test coverage metrics** and missing test recommendations
- **Performance concerns** with optimization suggestions
- **Technical debt assessment** with effort estimates
- **CI/CD metadata** for pipeline integration

#### 🚀 **Usage Examples**

#### Basic Usage:
```bash
goose run automated-code-review.yaml \
  --repository_path ./my-project \
  --programming_language Python
```

#### Advanced Usage:
```bash
goose run automated-code-review.yaml \
  --repository_path ./my-project \
  --programming_language JavaScript \
  --min_test_coverage 85 \
  --coding_standards ESLint \
  --security_focus comprehensive \
  --exclude_patterns "*.test.js,dist/*,node_modules/*"
```

#### 🔧 **CI/CD Integration**

The structured JSON output makes it perfect for CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Code Review
  run: |
    goose run automated-code-review.yaml \
      --repository_path . \
      --programming_language ${{ matrix.language }} \
      --output review-results.json

- name: Process Results
  run: |
    # Parse JSON results for pipeline decisions
    RECOMMENDATION=$(jq -r '.review_summary.recommendation' review-results.json)
    if [ "$RECOMMENDATION" = "reject" ]; then
      exit 1
    fi
```

#### 📁 **File Structure**

The recipe is saved as `automated-code-review.yaml` in your current directory and includes:
- Proper YAML structure following goose recipe format
- Comprehensive parameter definitions with defaults
- Built-in developer extension for file system access
- Detailed JSON schema for structured output
- Template syntax for parameter substitution

Your development team can immediately start using this recipe by placing it in their project repositories and customizing the parameters for their specific needs!

  You are an expert code reviewer with deep knowledge of software engineering best practices, 
  security vulnerabilities, and testing methodologies. Your role is to perform a thorough 
  code review focusing on:
  
  1. Code Quality & Best Practices
  2. Security Vulnerabilities  
  3. Test Coverage Analysis
  4. Performance Concerns
  5. Maintainability Issues
  
  Always provide actionable feedback with specific examples and suggestions for improvement.
  Consider the specified programming language conventions and coding standards.
