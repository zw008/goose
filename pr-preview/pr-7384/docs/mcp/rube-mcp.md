## What is Rube?

Rube is a platform powered by Composio that provides unified access to 500+ apps and services through a single integration. It enables seamless connectivity across different applications without additional setup, making it perfect for both individual users and teams.

## Configuration

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
    <GooseDesktopInstaller
      extensionId="rube"
      extensionName="Rube"
      description="Seamlessly connect across 500+ applications including Slack, Gmail, Notion, Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, GitHub, and many more"
      type="http"
      url="https://rube.app/mcp"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
    <CLIExtensionInstructions
      name="rube"
      description="Seamlessly connect across 500+ applications including Slack, Gmail, Notion, Google Workspace, Microsoft Office, GitHub, and many more"
      type="http"
      url="https://rube.app/mcp"
      timeout={300}
      infoNote="OAuth authentication will happen automatically in your browser when you first use Rube tools"
    />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Authentication

Rube uses OAuth browser authentication, which means:
- No manual API keys to manage
- Secure authentication handled automatically
- When you first use a Rube tool, your browser will open to authenticate with the relevant service
- Authentication tokens are securely stored and managed by Rube

## Example Usage

Once Rube is configured, you can interact with 500+ apps directly through goose. Here are some examples:

**Email Management**
```
Send an email to john@example.com with subject "Meeting Update" and body "The meeting has been moved to 3 PM"
```

**Slack Communication**
```
Post a message to the #general channel saying "Deploy completed successfully"
```

**GitHub Integration**
```
Create a new issue in my repository with title "Bug Report" and description "Found an issue with the login flow"
```

**Google Sheets**
```
Add a new row to my "Sales Data" spreadsheet with values: Date: today, Amount: 1500, Client: Acme Corp
```

**Calendar Management**
```
Schedule a meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM with title "Project Review" and invite sarah@company.com
```

The first time you use tools for a specific service, you'll be prompted to authenticate through OAuth in your browser. After that, all subsequent interactions with that service will work seamlessly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Extension not connecting**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection and that `https://rube.app` is accessible from your network.
- **Authentication issues**: If OAuth flows aren't working, try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser.
- **Tool timeouts**: Some operations with large datasets may take longer. You can increase the timeout value in the extension settings if needed.
- **Rate limits**: Rube respects the rate limits of individual services. If you hit limits, wait a few minutes before retrying.
