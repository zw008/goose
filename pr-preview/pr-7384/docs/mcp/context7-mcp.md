This tutorial covers how to add the [Context7 MCP Server](https://github.com/upstash/context7) as a goose extension to pull up-to-date, version-specific code and docs so goose can vibe code with real context, not hallucinated or outdated answers.

:::tip TLDR
<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
  [Launch the installer](goose://extension?cmd=npx&arg=-y&arg=%40upstash%2Fcontext7-mcp&id=context7&name=Context7&description=Context7%20MCP%20server%20for%20up-to-date%20code%20and%20docs)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">
  **Command**
  ```sh
  npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

:::info
Note that you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to run this command, as it uses `npx`.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
    <GooseDesktopInstaller
      extensionId="context7"
      extensionName="Context7"
      description="Context7 MCP server for up-to-date code and docs"
      command="npx"
      args={["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]}

## Example Usage

In this example, goose uses Context7 to pull real-time docs, compare tools, and scaffold a modern app using only the latest, official implementation patterns.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="goose Desktop" default>
   1. Open a new session in goose Desktop
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="goose CLI">

  1. Open a terminal and start a new goose session:

  ```sh
  goose session
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### goose Prompt

I need help building a modern web application. Could you:

1. Use Context7 to analyze and compare:

- Next.js App Router vs Pages Router
- Prisma vs other ORMs
- Different authentication approaches
- State management solutions

2. For each technology chosen:

- Show the latest official implementation patterns
- Provide type definitions and interfaces
- Share relevant code snippets from documentation
- Explain best practices and common pitfalls

3. Help implement:

- Project structure following official guidelines
- Database schema and type safety
- Authentication flow with proper security
- API routes with error handling
- Performance optimizations

Please reference specific documentation sections and explain why certain approaches are recommended over others.

1. Technology Analysis
Next.js App Router vs Pages Router
First, let's get the latest Next.js documentation:

-------- Resolve-library-id -------

Let's get detailed documentation about Next.js, focusing on routing:

------ Get-library-docs ---------

Let me analyze the Next.js documentation and break down the key differences between the App Router and Pages Router:

------ code structure comparison -----

Let's get information about Prisma and other ORMs:

------- Resolve-library-id ---------- 

Let's get Prisma's documentation:

------ Get-library-docs ----------

Key Decisions and Best Practices:

1. App Router vs Pages Router:

Chose App Router for:
Server Components by default (better performance)
Built-in data fetching with streaming
Simpler API routes with Route Handlers
Better TypeScript integration

2. Prisma as ORM:

Benefits:
Type-safe database queries
Auto-generated client
Schema migrations
Rich query API
Using Prisma Accelerate for better performance

3. Authentication:

NextAuth.js for:
Built-in security features
Multiple authentication providers
Session management
JWT handling

4. Performance Optimizations:

Server Components for reduced JavaScript
Route Handlers for API endpoints
Prisma Accelerate for database performance
Type safety across the stack

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or help you implement specific features?
