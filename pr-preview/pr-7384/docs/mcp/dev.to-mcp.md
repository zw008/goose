This tutorial covers how to add the [Dev.to MCP Server](https://github.com/nickytonline/dev-to-mcp) as a goose extension to enable access to the Dev.to public API. With this extension, goose can fetch articles, tags, user info, comments, and more—without requiring authentication.

  Use `goose configure` to add a `Remote Extension (Streaming HTTP)` extension type with:

  **Endpoint URL**

  ```

**Required Setup** 

Make sure your Dev.to MCP server is running before adding the extension

## Configuration

:::info
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You’ll also need to run `npm install` and `npm run build` once before using the server.
:::

1. First, clone and set up the `Dev.to MCP server`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nickytonline/dev-to-mcp.git
cd dev-to-mcp
npm install
npm run build # one-time setup
```
```bash
npm start
```
Your server will now be running at:
`http://localhost:3000/mcp`

## Example Usage

In this example, goose uses the `Dev.to MCP` extension to fetch the 5 most recent JavaScript articles and instantly turn them into a personalized learning hub.

### goose Prompt
```
Hey goose, fetch the 5 most recent JavaScript articles from Dev.to
Create a simple HTML landing page that:

1. Lists each article title as a clickable link

2. Includes the author and a 1‑sentence summary under each title

3. Suggests a small project or code snippet I could build to apply what I learned from each article (if applicable)

4. Highlights which article I should read first if I only have time for one and explain why

The goal is to save me time by quickly showing what’s worth reading and help me learn faster by giving actionable practice ideas.
```
